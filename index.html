		The Book Fair (04.26, 2-6PM EST <svg height="9" width="9" class="blinking"><circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4" fill="red" /></svg> )  is a quarterly lecture series where selected contributors to The Stacks talk about the inputs and inspirations that have had a significant impact on their lives and careers.

		<br><br>
		The Book Fair is open and free to the public. The virtual nature of these events are partly fueled by the situation we find ourselves in, and partly because using the power of the web helps democratize these talks. After the virtual event, the talks will be archived on The Stacks in their respective folders. Our first group of speakers on April 26th will be cofounder & partner at PLAYLAB Inc -  <a href="https://www.playlab.org/" target="_blank">Archie Lee Coates IV</a>, illustrator & art director - <a href="https://simonenoronha.com/" target="_blank">Simone Noronha</a>, award winning curator & writer - <a href="https://sararaza.com/" target="_blank">Sara Raza</a>, and artist & partner at School - <a href="http://andrewherzog.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Herzog</a>.

		<br><br><br>
		The Stacks is a digital public archive of things recommended by working creatives for anyone to root through and find inspiration.

		Those things (books, films, videos, art, lectures, places, and people) are organized into folders bearing the names of creatives who’ve filled them. We hope their content can act as a catalyst for inquiry and learning. Launching on April 26th, along with The Book Fair, the goal is to create an ever-evolving depository of inputs and inspirations that can offer an ever-growing source of insights for young creatives and lifelong students.

		The Stacks will open on 04.26
